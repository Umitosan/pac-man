# Pac Man

The classic arcade game recreated using HTML5's canvas.  

This entire project was created by reading and viewing the original game and replicating features one by one.  All of my implementation of these features are simply my own creative solutions.  Before learning design patterns that are more  'correct', I wanted to explore my own solutions and later compare them to better patterns.

This has been and extremely fun task for me and I've learned a lot about game design and javascript in the process.

## bug list

* element focus / keybindings should be better, easy to lose focus

## features needed

* Inky and Clyde should exit the ghost house faster after the first time they do (when eaten, Pac dies)
* Blinky should speed up slightly over time? or lvl? or pills eaten?
* Levels should change multiple elements of the game making it harder
   * the duration of ghosts fleeing when the big pills are eaten should shorten with each level until it's 0 seconds of flees
* add fruit bonuses!
* deep dive into JS and Canvas docs to make performance better!
